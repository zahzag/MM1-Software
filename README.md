## Overview

This software simulates an M/M/1-FCFS queue on real hardware to study the impact of CPU frequency (DVFS) on performance and power consumption. The system consists of:

- A **client** that generates jobs with a configurable exponential inter-arrival rate and sends them to the server over a dedicated network link.
- A **server** that processes jobs one at a time on a single isolated CPU core, acting as the single server in the M/M/1 model, and collects performance metrics.

---

## Architecture

### Client

The client (`client.LoadGenerator`) sends jobs to the server using an exponential inter-arrival distribution. It is configured with three parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                              |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `lambda`   | Mean arrival rate (jobs/sec)                             |
| `duration` | Total duration for sending jobs to the server (seconds)  |
| `repeat`   | Workload size per job; distributed exponentially between `repeat` and `1.6 × repeat` to simulate exponential service times |

### Server

The server (`Server.Server`) accepts incoming jobs over TCP/UDP, queues them, and processes them **one by one** on a single CPU core (M/M/1-FCFS discipline). After processing, it computes and records:

- Mean service rate (μ)
- Mean response time
- CPU utilization (ρ)
- Highest reached queue state
- CPU time and execution time
- Other performance and power metrics

Results are saved to `workbook.xlsx`.

### Job

The `Job` class defines the structure of each work unit arriving from the client. Its `calc()` method performs a CPU-intensive calculation repeated proportionally to the job size (`repeat`). The workload is calibrated so that CPU utilization does not sustain 100% for more than ~1 second at the peak.

---

## Hardware Preparation

To obtain reproducible and accurate measurements, the following hardware configuration steps are required before running the simulation.

### 1. Fix Server IP Address

The client sends jobs to `10.0.0.2` on ports `9999` (jobs) and `9950` (reset signals). Configure the server's Ethernet interface accordingly:

```bash
# Assign the IP address (replace enp0s31f6 with your NIC name)
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev enp0s31f6
sudo ip link set enp0s31f6 up

# Allow the required ports through the firewall
sudo ufw allow 9999/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9999/udp
sudo ufw allow 9950/tcp
sudo ufw allow 9950/udp
sudo ufw enable

# Verify
sudo ufw status
```

### 2. CPU Shielding

Shielding a CPU core prevents the OS from scheduling other processes on it, keeping it fully available for the server's job-handling thread.

> **Note:** Using `cset shield` alone is not recommended here, because it prevents the server from directly using the shielded core. You would need `taskset` to pin the process to it, which does not isolate the job-handling thread from the listening thread. The `Affinity` Java library used by the server automatically detects and pins to an isolated core — no manual `cset` pinning is needed for the server.


#### Ubuntu

```bash
# 1. Edit GRUB (replace 3 with your target CPU ID)
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
#   Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX: isolcpus=3,

# 2. Regenerate GRUB config
sudo update-grub

# 3. Reboot
```


### 3. CPU Pinning

The `Affinity` library inside the server automatically pins the job-handling thread to an isolated/shielded core. No manual pinning is required for the server.

If needed, the client can be pinned to a different core to avoid disturbing the server:

```bash
# Pin client to core 8 (choose a core different from the server's core)
taskset -c 8 java client.LoadGenerator <lambda> <duration> <repeat>
```

### 4. Disable Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) / Hyper-Threading

The M/M/1 model requires a single server (one physical core, one thread). Disabling SMT/HT ensures no hidden parallelism.

#### Temporary — Ubuntu
```bash
echo off | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control
```


#### Permanent — Ubuntu

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
#   Add to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX: isolcpus=3 noht

sudo update-grub
# Reboot
```

### 5. Disable Turbo Boost

Intel Turbo Boost dynamically raises the clock speed under load. It must be disabled so that CPU frequency is controlled exclusively by the selected governor and frequency range.

#### Temporary

```bash
# Disable
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo

# Re-enable
echo 0 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/no_turbo
```

#### Permanent (via BIOS)

1. Reboot and enter BIOS.
2. Navigate to the **Performance** section.
3. Uncheck **Enable Intel Turbo Boost**.
4. Apply and exit.

### 6. Intel P-State

Intel P-State is the voltage-frequency control driver used by modern Linux kernels. It must be set to **passive** mode so it does not interfere with governor-controlled frequency scaling.

> **Important:** Do **not** disable `intel_pstate` from the BIOS. Doing so removes access to frequency monitoring and governor control. Instead, set it to `passive` mode.

```bash
# Set to passive (disables active P-State management)
echo passive | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/status

# Re-enable active P-State management
echo active | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/status
```

### 7. Intel Speed Step

Intel Speed Step dynamically adjusts CPU clock speed and voltage based on load. It must be disabled from the BIOS to prevent uncontrolled frequency changes during experiments.

1. Reboot and enter BIOS.
2. Navigate to the **Performance** section.
3. Uncheck **Enable Intel Speed Step**.
4. Apply and exit.

### 8. CPU Governors

CPU governors control frequency scaling in response to workload. This experiment focuses on the **OnDemand** governor, which scales frequency up when utilization exceeds a configurable threshold.

#### Set governor using `cpupower` (recommended)

```bash
# Set OnDemand governor on CPU core 3
sudo cpupower --cpu 3 frequency-set -g ondemand

# Set frequency range (example: 0.8 GHz to 2.1 GHz)
sudo cpupower --cpu 3 frequency-set -d 0.8GHz -u 2.1GHz

# Verify
sudo cpupower --cpu 3 frequency-info
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/cpufreq/scaling_governor
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu3/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
```

#### Configure OnDemand parameters

```bash
# Set sampling rate to 10 ms (10000 µs)
echo 10000 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/sampling_rate

# Set up-threshold to 75%
echo 75 | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/ondemand/up_threshold
```

## Network Setup

Client and server must be on the same network. A direct **RJ45 cable** connection is recommended for minimal latency.

### Server

| Setting      | Value              |
|--------------|--------------------|
| IP address   | `10.0.0.2/24`      |
| Listening ports | `9999` (TCP/UDP), `9950` (TCP/UDP) |

```bash
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev enp1s0   # replace enp1s0 with your NIC name
sudo ip link set enp1s0 up

sudo ufw allow 9999/tcp && sudo ufw allow 9999/udp
sudo ufw allow 9950/tcp && sudo ufw allow 9950/udp
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

### Client

| Setting      | Value              |
|--------------|--------------------|
| IP address   | `10.0.0.1/24`      |

```bash
sudo ip addr add 10.0.0.1/24 dev eno1     # replace eno1 with your NIC name
sudo ip link set eno1 up

sudo ufw allow 9999/tcp && sudo ufw allow 9999/udp
sudo ufw allow 9950/tcp && sudo ufw allow 9950/udp
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status
```

### Verify Connectivity

```bash
# From server
ping 10.0.0.1

# From client
ping 10.0.0.2
```

## Monitoring

### CPU Utilization — `mpstat`

Monitor the utilization of CPU core 3 (the `%usr` column) while the server is running. At the end of the experiment, `mpstat` reports the average utilization over the measurement interval.

#### Install

```bash
# Ubuntu
sudo apt install sysstat
sudo systemctl enable sysstat && sudo systemctl start sysstat
```

#### Run

```bash
# Sample CPU core 3 every 1 second and log to file
mpstat -P 3 1 > cpu3.log
```

A Python script is provided to extract the average utilization and append it to the results Excel file.

### CPU Power Consumption


#### Powerstat

`powerstat` measures system-level power using ACPI battery data (not per-core).

```bash
# Install — Ubuntu
sudo apt install powerstat

# Run
powerstat -cDHRf 1
```

java Server.Server 5
```

### Run Client

```bash
cd build
export CLASSPATH="../Server/Server/lib/*:."

# java client.LoadGenerator <lambda> <duration> <repeat>
# Example:
java client.LoadGenerator 5 600000 1000000
```

| Argument   | Example     | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `lambda`   | `5`         | Mean arrival rate (jobs/sec)                                                |
| `duration` | `600000`    | Duration of job sending in milliseconds (600 000 ms = 10 minutes)          |
| `repeat`   | `1000000`   | Base workload size per job; actual size is exponentially distributed between `repeat` and `1.6 × repeat` |

> A larger `repeat` value results in heavier CPU load per job.

## Simulation Details

### Choosing the Arrival Rate (λ)

The arrival rate **must satisfy λ < μ** (the system must remain stable). If λ ≥ μ the queue grows unboundedly and the system overflows.

**Procedure:**

1. Run the server once at each target CPU frequency to measure the mean service rate **μ**.
2. Compute arrival rates corresponding to target utilization levels (10%, 20%, …, 90%) using:

$$\lambda = \rho \times \mu$$

3. Since this study focuses on the **OnDemand** governor with a frequency range [minFreq, maxFreq], the arrival rates are selected based on the service rate measured at **maxFreq**.

### Simulation Flow

1. The client begins sending jobs exponentially at rate λ.
2. The server enqueues jobs and processes them one by one (FCFS).
3. When the client sends a **`RESET2`** packet and the server queue drains to empty, the server computes and writes the following metrics to `workbook.xlsx`:
   - Mean service rate (μ)
   - Mean response time
   - Highest reached system state
   - CPU time and execution time
   - CPU utilization (ρ)
   - Additional performance and power metrics
