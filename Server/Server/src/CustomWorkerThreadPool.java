 * immediately after a job departs, updating the shared state histogram stored in
 * {@link Server#hmap} and tracking the highest state ever observed in
 * {@link Server#highest_state}. These statistics are used to compute the
 * steady-state probabilities of the queuing system.</p>
 *
 * <p>It also overrides {@code beforeExecute()} as a hook point for any logic that
 * needs to run just before a worker thread picks up a task (currently delegates
 * to the parent implementation).</p>
